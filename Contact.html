  <h4>Here's a short poem to send you off</h4>
	

  <p>In this digital world we live,</p>
	<p> Communication is key, let's give
	  A chance to connect and share
	  Our thoughts, our dreams, our flair.</p>
	<p>Don't hesitate to send a line
Or pick up the phone and call, it's fine
I'm always here and ready to hear
Your questions, comments, and career.</p>
	<p>Thank you for taking the time
To visit my contact page, a climb
That leads to new opportunities and more
Let's stay in touch, and open doors.</p>
