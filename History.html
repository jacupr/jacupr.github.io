  <p>I have had the privilege of working in various roles across different industries, each of which has given me valuable experience and skills.</p><br>
	<p>Currently, I am working as an AFE Packer at Amazon Warehouse in Garner, NC. Since January 2023, I have been responsible for packing orders into designated boxes/bags, ensuring accuracy and timeliness in meeting customer demands.</p><br>
	 <p>Prior to this, I worked as a Ham Conversion specialist at Smithfield Foods in Tar Heel, NC, from July 2022 to December 2022. In this role, I cut the ham off the pig's leg, ensuring the quality of the meat</p><br>
	<p>Before that, I worked at Mueller Water Products in Saint Pauls, NC, as an OEM specialist from March 2022 to July 2022. Here, I used my skills in brazing and soldering to work with copper pipes. I also water tested and packed them, ensuring they met the required quality standards.</p><br>
	<p>Unfortunately, the department moved to Mexico, and I had to find a new job. I then worked as a Cut Floor specialist at Smithfield Foods in Tar Heel, NC, from July 2021 to February 2022. In this role, I was responsible for cutting the shoulder bone out of the pig, ensuring the meat was prepared correctly.</p><br>
	<p>Before that, I worked as a Live Hanger at Wayne-Sanderson Farms in Saint Pauls, NC, from March 2021 to July 2021. In this role, I live hung 28 chickens a minute, ensuring that they were handled humanely and efficiently.</p><br>

	<p>Finally, I worked as a Warehouse Associate at Walmart in Davenport, FL, from August 2020 to February 2021. Here, I was responsible for unloading and receiving packages from trucks, ensuring they were stored and managed efficiently.</p><br>
	<p>Overall, my work history demonstrates my ability to learn quickly, adapt to new environments, and develop skills in a range of industries.</p><br>
