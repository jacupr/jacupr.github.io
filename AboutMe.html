<div class="WelcomeText">
  <p>In my free time, I have several hobbies that I enjoy. Reading nonfiction books and articles is one of my favorites as it allows me to learn about new topics and expand my knowledge base. I find this activity to be both informative and relaxing. Additionally, playing with my dogs, Chaos and Remy, is another activity that brings me joy. They always brighten my day and provide me with much-needed companionship.</p>

	<p>I have had a unique experience during the pandemic. Due to the constant need to move, I have gained a lot of experience in various fields. This has allowed me to explore new opportunities and grow in my career. As a result, I am now able to provide even more valuable services to those around me. I am excited to continue this growth and see where it takes me.</p><br>
	<p>Looking to the future, I am eager to continue developing my skills and seeking out new opportunities for growth. I believe that as I continue to push myself forward, I will be able to make a positive impact on the world around me. I am grateful for the experiences I have had so far, and I am excited to see what the future holds. I am currently pursuing an Associates in Applied Science for Computer Programming and Development at Wake Tech.</p>
